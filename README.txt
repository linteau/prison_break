After you have the files on your computer, you can 
run the game just as you would run any ruby script.

Enter the command 'ruby main.rb' without the quotes of course.

If you have any questions, send them to andy.linteau@gmail.com.

The main reason I made this game was to practice and improve my
ruby skills. 

Any feedback is welcomed.
