Assumptions: 

You have ruby on your computer and you 
know enough about ruby scripts to run them.


To run the game, go to the prison_break directory
and enter the command 'ruby main.rb' without the
quotes of course. At this point the game will start. 

If you have any questions, send them to andy.linteau@gmail.com.

The main reason I made this game was to practice and improve my
ruby skills. The point wasn't to make the best use of OOP, but was
to get use to having different classes interact with eachother.

Any feedback is welcomed.

Thanks,

Andy
